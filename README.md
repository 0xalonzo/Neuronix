## About Neuronix

Neuronix was created to help users understand the foundational matrix operations in neural networks, such as:
- Forward propagation using matrix multiplication.
- Applying activation functions (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU).
- Backpropagation with gradient descent for weight updates.

The project walks through creating and training a small neural network with customizable learning parameters, batch processing, and basic visualization of the networkâ€™s predictions.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Matrix manipulations with NumPy for efficient data handling.
- **Neural Network Layers**: Define and configure input, hidden, and output layers with matrix weights and biases.
- **Activation Functions**: Implement common activation functions like Sigmoid and ReLU.
- **Forward and Backward Propagation**: Simulate neural network learning with manual gradient descent or PyTorch optimizers.
- **Training Visualization**: Monitor training loss and output predictions.
